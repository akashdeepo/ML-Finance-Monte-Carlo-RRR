## Advanced Financial Market Forecasting: Integrating Monte Carlo Simulations with Ensemble Machine Learning Models

This repository hosts the code and associated data for the project "Advanced Financial Market Forecasting: Integrating Monte Carlo Simulations with Ensemble Machine Learning Models." It includes financial market analysis using Monte Carlo simulations combined with Machine Learning techniques, focusing on risk-reward ratios for various stocks and the SPY ETF.

### Repository Contents

- `*.csv`: Financial data for companies like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, and SPY ETF.
- `*.png`: Visualization outputs including Monte Carlo simulation flowcharts and risk-reward comparison charts.
- `main.ipynb`, `main2.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks containing the core analysis and modeling.
- `monte_carlo_spy_percentiles.csv`: Output data from Monte Carlo simulations for SPY ETF.
- `README.md`: Overview and guide for the repository.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repo to your local machine using:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/akashdeepo/ML-Finance-Monte-Carlo-RRR-
     ```

2. **Installation**
   - It's recommended to create a virtual environment for this project.
   - Install the required packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run `.ipynb` files.

### Usage

- Open the Jupyter notebooks (`main.ipynb` or `main2.ipynb`) to view the analysis.
- CSV files contain the financial data used in the analysis.
- PNG files are visual outputs that can be referenced for insights and presentations.
